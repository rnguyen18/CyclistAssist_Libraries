# CyclistAssist Libraries
The microcontroller depends on these libraries to function correctly. These libraries separate the concerns as well as contains the main pieces of code to operate the microcontroller.
## How to install
In order to install the CyclistAssist Library the main method is to create a new folder called libraries within the Arduino folder, so the directory looks as it does below.
> \Documents\Arduino\libraries

Then move the files from this repository and place them within the newly created folder. It should contain the folders.
> BluetoothController
> LightController

Now these libraries can be freely used within any Arduino projects.
